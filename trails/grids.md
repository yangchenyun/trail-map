Validation
----------

You can use a grid in a design when you can:

* Create inner axial alignment.
* Edit and/or build a grid according to the content in your design (not using a
  prebuilt framework).
* Have symmetrical and asymmetrical balance in your designs.
* Keep consistent vertical and horizontal space.
* Use the grid to create active white space within a design.
* Use the grid to strengthen the contents hierarchy.
* Use a more complex grid system than a equal column 3 or 4 column grid.
