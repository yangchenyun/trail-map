Trail map maintained by Zenhacks
=========

The trail maps are originated by [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/trail-map). We embraced their concepts for learning different technology. They said:
Why Make Another one
------
We found some trails([`unix`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/trail-map/blob/master/trails/unix.md), [`ruby`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/trail-map/blob/master/trails/ruby.md)) are difficult to finish in a short term and and the validation is too vague. This is mainly caused by scope of the topic itself. To resolve this problem, we decide to break down large iteration into smaller trails and each with additional materials and validation.

With this smaller trail maps, we could:
* Focus on one topic at a time
* More targeted learning materials
* Faster feedback circle and keep our morale high
* More specific validation to ensure a solid learning result
